# QuPyt

Starting to delete obsolete files

## Purpose

This repository is designed to enable NV-diamond based quantum sensing experiments.
It is developed by the Bucher research group at TUM.
Features include:

+ Connectivity to AWGs, signal sources, and cameras
+ Connectivity to tools designed to automate workflow (Autofocus)
+ Pulsesequence design for various pulsesequences (ESR, Rabi, Synchronised Readout,...)
+ Data analysis
+ A database connection to track measurements

## Installation

Currently the repo is typically not installed and does not feature support for installation.
Measurements scripts can be run from the associated folders.
Folders to store measurements, logfiles and the database have to be created manually.
Default locations work for Linux based systems -> adapt username...

This will be improved in the future...
