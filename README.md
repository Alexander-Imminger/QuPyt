# QuPyt

Welcome to QuPyt! We love Quantum Sensing and Python. 



The project you are currently visiting is still under heavy development, and we have **not yet settled on a license**. We kindly ask you to not use or copy QuPyt without consulting with us first! We plan to change this in the coming months and provide QuPyt under a standard license.



Starting with version 1.0 we will adhere to semantic versioning. 



If you want to start contributing of using QuPyt for your own research of application, feel free to reach out!



Please expect breaking changes to the API in the coming months. We plan to make the API stable until April 2024.
